Me thinking about automated algorithms

So, this has 2 aspects to is - the machine learning of news articles, and scraping data from the telegraph website and
analysing it.  It was my first go, and is a complete hack - it mostly does stuff (see the write up on my website) but it
was getting truely painful to maintain and extend.  I don't want to comment it, I'd have to understand it again.

I would split this up into distinct sections, web scrape using Scrapy into a NoSQL db, form various bits of the db around
different websites and techniques, store the post-processing in a different, half-tempory table, things like that.  
If I do that version of it, I might upload it.
